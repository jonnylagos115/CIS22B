   C-strings and arrays of pointers

   This program uses a selection sort to sort an array of c-strings.
   It has some errors. Fix the errors and run the program.

 A NOTE about pointers and constants: pointer constant versus pointer to constant


 const char *list[10] = {"Mary", "John", "Peter", "Anne",
                         "Paul",  "Andrew", "Linda",  "Diane"};

 What is list?

 list is an array of 10 pointers to string literals (or constants):
 the strings in the array may not be changed but the pointers pointing to these strings could change.

 Therefore the following statement is incorrect
 strcpy(list[0], "Tom"); // This is an attempt to change a constant: replace "Mary" by "Tom"

 It is OK to change the pointers in the list:
 list[0] = list[1]; // now both pointers point to "John"

 Here are some examples

 EXAMPLE ONE: A pointer variable pointing to a constant
 const double PI = 3.14;
 const double EPSILON = 0.001;
 const double *ptr = &PI;
 cout << *ptr << endl;

 // *ptr += 1;     //<==== this doesn't work because PI should not change
 ptr = &EPSILON;  // but you are allowed to change ptr, to make it point to another constant
 cout << *ptr << endl;

 EXAMPLE TWO: A pointer constant pointing to a constant
 const double PI = 3.14;
 const double EPSILON = 0.001;
 const double * const ptr = &PI; // both ptr and its pointee (PI) are constants
 cout << *ptr << endl;

 // *ptr += 10; // doesn't work because its pointee is PI, a constant (it may not be changed)
 // ptr = &EPSILON;  // doesn't work because because ptr is also a constant (it may not be changed)
