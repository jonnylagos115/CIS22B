/***************************************************************
 Definition of binarySearch function
 The binarySearch function performs a binary search on an
 integer array. array, which has a maximum of numElems
 elements, is searched for the number stored in value. If the
 number is found, its array subscript is returned. Otherwise,
 -1 is returned indicating the value was not in the array.
